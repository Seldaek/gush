### What is this?

Gush is an app console whose intention is to automate common maintainer and contributor tasks.

- create a Pull Request with a formatted table description of the changes
- create github release notes
- change the base branch of a Pull Request
- automate retrieval of issue's message, title and comments as a text
- merge a PR with just the number and include all github discussion on the commit message
- tagging signing off, change branch name and some queue of common tasks

### Install

Install Gush in two ways:

#### 1) Installing as a composer global dependency (recommended)

If it is the first time you globally install a dependency then make sure
you follow the instructions [here](http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#global).

```bash
$ composer global require 'cordoval/gush=dev-master'
```

### Upgrade to latest version

```bash
$ composer global update cordoval/gush
```

#### 2) Installing as a phar file:

```
$ curl -sS https://bit.ly/gushphp | php
$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer // optionally
```

or

```
$ curl -sS https://bit.ly/gushphp | php -- --install-dir=bin
```

### Usage

You may want to start by configuring it:

```bash
$ gush configure
Insert your github credentials:
username: cordoval
password:
Cache folder [/Users/cordoval/.gush/cache]:
Configuration saved successfully.
```

Let's go into a repo, list, take ticket, send PR and merge it:

List it:
```bash
$ cd project_directory
$ gush issue:list
 #   State  PR?  Title                                     User       Assignee   Milestone        Labels       Created

```

Take it:
```bash
$ gush p:take 14

*Logo explanation is best depicted from this passage from Psalm 78*:

> True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread?
> Can he supply meat for his people?” When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against
> Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.

> There first thread of blood and the following are water gushing out of a rock, connecting the Old Testament
> prophecy fulfillment in the New Testament at the cross when Jesus was opened on his side and gushed out
> water and blood.
